AB  - Learning is a process that brings together personal and environmental experiences and influences for acquiring, enriching or modifying one’s knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, behaviors, and worldviews. Learning theories develop hypotheses that describe how this process takes place. The scientific study of learning started in earnest at the dawn of the twentieth century. Behaviorism, cognitivism, socio-constructivism, and other views have been proposed as emphasis has been placed on cognitive style and emerging educational technologies. These theories will be discussed in subsequent sections. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In the era of electronic-learning 3.0, existing dimensions related to technologies and learner are not adequately explored while discussing e-learning adoption. In the current study, technology and learner dimensions are converged to overcome this insufficiency in analysing e-learning adoption. Earlier studies have reported less about e-learning adoption in higher education through the users' lens. System parameters and learner attributes were derived from theories of information systems and literature on learning theories. To validate the research model, 704 responses were collected through a questionnaire survey from India, where e-learning is gearing up. The present article utilised Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), which describes the relationship between constructs in the research model. The study identifies technology and learner dimension factors that influence e-learning adoption in developing countries like India. The study also put forward implications and policy recommendations from the findings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have created a major paradigm shift in online education by offering web-based courses at no cost to virtually anyone with access to a computer/laptop with internet connection. In 2012, MOOCs gained significant attention from media, students, educators, and entrepreneurs. It is continuing to develop into a more popular and widespread educational technology. This paper identifies and discusses few key elements of massively open online education that can influence pedagogy and learning in STEM disciplines. It also examines the potential of MOOCs in improving learning experiences and facilitating interdisciplinary education in STEM fields. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In developing countries such as Haiti, which are marked by high unemployment and gender inequality, online education has the potential to change lives. Returns on education are particularly high in Information Communications Technology (ICT)-intensive jobs and IT outsourcing offers opportunities for remote employment, providing alternatives for economic diversification and job creation that are particularly relevant for youth and women. However, the problem faced by many developing countries, is that traditional models, frameworks, architectures, and platforms for online learning do not lend themselves well to their context and, therefore, it is important to develop context-specific platforms. This need for suitable platforms has motivated the research question that this paper seeks to address, that is: What is the appropriate architecture that supports learning strategies for delivering scalable digital skills training in a resource-constrained environment? We propose an architecture that was developed specifically for blended learning in resource-constrained environments and describe how a prototype for this was designed, built, and deployed in Haiti. The initial responses to the application of the architecture, including the testimonials of the participants and the interest expressed by other countries of the region in adopting the proposed architecture, have been extremely positive. © 2023 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - This paper explores online learners' preferences and experiences of using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a leaning environment. The paper thus intends to investigate what online learners prefer and what they experience while using MOOCs. The research employs exploratory approach using qualitative data. It considers reviews posted by the users of the two globally popular website for online learning namely edX (14 million learners) and Coursera (40 million learners). The total of 572 reviews is selected using simple random sampling. Selected reviews were refined based on language and appropriateness and then subjected to thematic analysis pinpointing and recording patterns of meaning (Themes). The thematic analysis presents a framework with eight dimensions to understand MOOC users' preferences. These identified dimensions are course diversification, experience, pedagogy, support, convenience, ease of use, monetary and quality. The proposed framework can be used to enhance learners experience and continuity of using MOOCs. In future researches, the framework can be tested empirically for its reliability and validity in our future research. © 2019 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. All rights reserved.

AB  - The authors consider the questions of the transformation of educational space in the modern digital era. They focus on the weakness of the theoretical foundation of e-learning in the context of mass practice of its implementation and application and discuss the legitimacy of applying traditional theories to e-learning in a radically changed educational space and the need to develop a new theory. Cognitivism, constructivism, and behaviorism are the basis of the traditional pedagogical system (class-lesson in school and lecture-seminar in universities). It is shown that a different pedagogical system is represented by connectivism – the theoretical construction of G. Siemens who created it as a “theory of the digital age.” On the basis of connectivism and for its study, G. Siemens and S. Downs have developed the first massive open online courses (cMOOC) – and this theoretical design was put into practice. One more learning technology similar to the connectivism was discovered, which is also based on a pedagogical system different from the traditional one. This made it possible to give the “learning theory of the digital age” a noticeable “historical volume”. The roots of the modern connectivism of massive open online courses have been discovered in Russia. One hundred years ago, the famous teacher Alexander Rivin for the first time realized the idea of collective mutual learning. This method which he called “talgenism” (a derivative of “talent” and “genius”) relied on “dialogical communication” in variable pairs and allowed to achieve incredible results in the joint training of people of different ages and different levels of training. The article traces the historical milestones of the development of the method of collective mutual learning in Russia and adduces the documentary evidence of experiments on the creation of a fundamentally different pedagogical system. The authors argue that the method of collective mutual learning (talgenism) of the Russian teacher A.G. Rivin and the technology of modern connectivism implemented in the massive open online courses with cMOOC of Canadian researchers G. Siemens and S. Downs have common key features. Despite the time and geographical gap (Russia, 1918 and Canada, 2008), each of these technologies makes it possible a fundamentally new learning process focused on the needs of a student, the organization of which is practically unattainable with a traditional class-lesson or lecture-seminar system. Both technologies are presented as effective practical implementations of the new education paradigm, which allows us to carefully and comprehensively study its elements. A conclusion is drawn on the prerequisites for the creation of a new learning theory which would become the foundation for a new time alternative pedagogy which could claim the status of a general theory, a base not only for distance, electronic, but also for classroom learning. © 2020 Moscow Polytechnic University.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze six learning theories, beyond those presented in an earlier article by the authors, and discuss their relevance and application in online instruction. Design/methodology/approach: The following databases were used to review the literature on adult learning theories: Academic Search Premier, ERIC and ProQuest. The following key search terms were used in the search process: online instruction, cognitivism, connectivism, heutagogy, social learning theory, transformative learning theory and Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development. The titles of the identified articles were first reviewed for relevance, followed by the abstract, before any further review for suitability for inclusion in this article. Findings: The theory comparison revealed that it is critical to ascertain which learning theory best matches an instructional situation and the background of the learners. The selected learning theories differ in several parameters. The theories were critiqued for their contributions to identified elements in promoting learning. The discussed theories suggest ways to improve online learning environments. Research limitations/implications: Many adult perspectives about learning, while called theories, are largely lacking in evidence leading to them becoming theories. Thus, there remains a need for empirical evidence of these theories and their roles in online instruction. Comparisons of the application of these theories for adult learners in online instruction would also be useful in establishing the effectiveness of the various learning theories in different adult learning situations. Practical implications: This paper provides a theoretical lens for adult instructors and instructional designers in incorporating these adult learning theories appropriately in improving online instruction. Originality/value: This literature review uniquely critiques and compares common adult theories as they apply to adult online instruction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Active learning is not a simple practice. It is a new paradigm for the provision of high-quality, collaborative, engaging, and motivating education. Active learning has the capacity to respond to most of the challenges that institutions of higher education are facing in our time. In this chapter, we present active learning strategies used in STEM disciplines and we analyze the potential of active learning to redefine the value proposition in academic institutions. After providing the theoretical underpinnings of active learning as an evolving practice, an attempt is made to connect it with different learning theories and present an integrative model in which institutional strategies, learning strategy and information, and communication technologies work synergistically toward the development of knowledge and skills. We then present the results of a survey examining “stories” of active learning from the STEM disciplines, identifying good teaching practices, and discussing challenges and lessons learned. The key idea is that active engagement and participation of students is based on faculty commitments and inspiration and mentoring by faculty. We finally present a stage model for the implementation of active learning practices in higher education. Emphasis is put on a new vision for higher education, based on systematic planning, implementation, and evaluation of active learning methods, collaboration, engagement with society and industry, innovation, and sustainability, for a better world for all. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The new paradigm in employee development assumes that employees should proactively direct their learning and growth. Most workplace learning is basically informal and occurs through daily-work routines, peer-to-peer interactions, and networking, and typically brings about signifi cant positive outcomes to both individuals and organizations. Yet, workplace learning always occurs in a predefi ned context and this context has recently changed. Hereafter, many people have been delegated to work from home or any other remote location. Many employees would like to maintain remote or hybrid work design in the future, as well. In this research monograph, the authors explore an unexplored topic in social science research concerning proactive employee development through informal learning in new ways of working (NWW). The monograph will be of interest to students and researchers in organizational studies, organizational behavior, organizational psychology, and organizational learning, as well as human resource professionals concerned with employee development and the changing nature of work. © 2024 Malgorzata Rozkwitalska-Welenc, Beata A.

AB  - This article presents a pedagogical model specifically designed to encourage the generation of shared knowledge among participants in a virtual community and the process followed to develop it. The model is based on three pillars: 1) structured learning resources that allow individual and collaborative work by the user; 2) game mechanics that increase participation in the community; 3) dynamisation of the community by the community manager or facilitator. The model was developed starting with a literature review of open learning systems, and specifically, massive online open courses. This review served as a basis to design a specific tool to assess these courses and identify best practices. The tool was subjected to an inter-rater evaluation process prior to its application.

AB  - This study explored how the use of three different pedagogical frameworks (community science, storytelling, and inquiry-based learning) influenced learners' awareness and appreciation of flagellate plants in an undergraduate online botany course. Students' opinions, attitudes, and perceptions toward science were explored using the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience survey. Qualitative and quantitative results indicated that although most students appreciated all three activities, the storytelling activity produced the most positive perceptions of learning. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that gender and attitudes toward science influenced student perceptions of the activities. Positive science attitudes predicted positive perceptions of the activities, and female students were more likely to report positive perceptions. These results suggest that as a pedagogical framework for organizing learning activities, storytelling holds potential for promoting positive attitudes toward science and science learning, particularly with female learners. © 2021 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore Indonesian and Malaysian instructors’ perceptions of massive open online course (MOOC) design and how they deal with the design challenges. Surveys, email interviews, and course reviews are the main data-collection methods employed in this sequential mixed methods study. Forty-six instructors participated in the survey, and nine of them voluntarily participated in an email interview. The findings revealed that half of the courses were delivered using a hybrid/blended type of MOOC. Personal motives, institutional encouragement, and altruism were among the main reasons for instructors to offer MOOCs. Preparation, attraction, participation, and assessment were the categories used to explain the design strategies used by these instructors in designing their courses. The survey also revealed that collaboration encouragement, participant engagement, video development, and time constraints were the primary design challenges that the instructors experienced during the design process. Furthermore, most instructors sought advice from other MOOC instructors, MOOC providers, their institutions, video tutorials, and open educational resources (OERs) to surmount their design challenges. © 2019, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - This review of research explores characteristics associated with massive open online courses (MOOCs). Three key characteristics are revealed: varied definitions of openness, barriers to persistence, and a distinct structure that takes the form as one of two pedagogical approaches. The concept of openness shifts among different MOOCs, models, researchers, and facilitators. The high dropout rates show that the barriers to learning are a significant challenge. Research has focused on engagement, motivation, and presence to mitigate risks of learner isolation. The pedagogical structure of the connectivist MOOC model (cMOOC) incorporates a social, distributed, networked approach and significant learner autonomy that is geared towards adult lifelong learners interested in personal or professional development. This connectivist approach relates to situated and social learning theories such as social constructivism (Kop, 2011). By contrast, the design of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence (AI) model (xMOOC) uses conventional directed instruction in the context of formal postsecondary educational institutions. This traditional pedagogical approach is categorized as cognitive-behaviorist (Rodriguez, 2012). These two distinct MOOC models attract different audiences, use different learning approaches, and employ different teaching methods. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research describing the phenomenon of MOOCs in informal and postsecondary online learning.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the components of college students' readiness for connectivist learning in technology-enhanced learning environments through the development of the readiness for connectivist learning scale (RCLS). Design/methodology/approach: After the constructs of the scale had been identified, their items were created based on the relevant literature. In order to ensure the content validity of the items, a sorting procedure was implemented and they were reviewed by experts in the field. The construct validity of the scale was tested using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with data from 718 students from a university in Turkey. Findings: The findings of the current study indicated a four-factor solution, which includes information and communication technology (ICT) self-efficacy (seven items), autonomous learning (seven items), information literacy (eight items) and learning networks (five items). A significant, strong and positive correlation of students' scores on the RCLS with those of the online learning readiness scale (Hung et al., 2010) supported the criterion-related validity of the scale. The value of Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the RCLS showed good reliability for the scale. Originality/value: With the assessment of college students' readiness level for connectivist learning, it is possible for them to anticipate their success in connectivist learning environments themselves and thereby to improve the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for their success in these environments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - During such uncertain and disruptive times, the future of learning requires an attentive look and careful consideration. Technologies grow at a steady pace; educators are required to upskill constantly in a race to benefit from the latest innovations. However, the question remains: Are we ready to change the way we teach, learn, and most importantly, approach education? In this chapter, the authors argue about the importance of integrating learning theories in the instructional design used to engage with students and promote their learning in a hybrid approach. Finally, they look at potential fields of research to foster innovation in the EdTech sector. © 2022, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - India graduates 1.5 million engineering students every year, majority of them from its Tier 2 and Tier 3 colleges where there is severe shortage of qualified faculty and lab infrastructure, and where English is second or third language for most students. To provide affordable virtual laboratories to these engineering colleges, Government of India runs the Virtual Labs project with a select set of participating institutions to create virtual labs required for entire engineering student population of India. The program suffers from two problems: 1) lack of focus on pedagogy and learnability of labs being created, and 2) little ability to scale to more teachers and subject matter experts to produce labs aligned to local contexts. This paper presents a model (LEAD model) for the design of virtual labs for a data structures and algorithms course in computer science and is intended to address the problems stated above. The model encodes the principles of learning in the design and structure of an experiment so that labs can be learnable by design. The model is based on constructivist theory of learning. It uses Bloom's Taxonomy for defining learning objectives and applies Merrill's first principles and Gagne's 9 events of instruction as instructional design methodologies. To ensure tasks in an experiment indeed aid learning, the model requires a mapping between tasks and learning principles to be created and published along with the experiment. The model uses a pedagogy that lays strong emphasis on conceptual understanding without the use of code or program. To demonstrate the efficacy of this model, we present the data analysis of the feedback from early users of one the experiments. Even though limited in scope, data shows that experiments built using LEAD model can aid understanding for the students. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Law schools are failing both their staff and students by requiring them to prize reason and rationality and to suppress or ignore emotions. Despite innovations in terms of both content and teaching techniques, there is little evidence that emotions are effectively acknowledged or utilised within legal education. Instead law schools are clinging to an out-dated and erroneous perception of emotions as at best, irrational, and at worst dangerous. In contrast to this, educational and scientific developments have demonstrated that emotions are a fundamental, inescapable part of learning, teaching and skills development. Harnessing these emotions will therefore have a transformative effect on legal education and enable it to adapt to the needs and demands of the twenty-first century. This book provides a theoretical overview of the role played by emotions in all aspects of the life of the law school. It explores the relationship emotions have with key traditional and contemporary approaches to legal education, the ways in which emotions can be conceptualised, their interaction with the politics and policies of legal education and their role within teaching and learning. The book also considers the importance of emotional wellbeing for both law students and legal academics Overall, this book argues for a more holistic form of legal education in which emotions play a valuable (and valued) role. This requires a new vision for law schools, in which emotions are acknowledged and embedded at all levels, institutional and personal. © 2020 Emma Jones.

AB  - Collaborative discussions should engage all students, not just a few who dominate (“leaders”) while others participate as “followers” (Zhu, 2006). Cunningham (1991) noted that collaborating learners bring, discuss and debate multiple perspectives to develop their own position while acknowledging others' views. Higher levels of knowledge construction emerged when posts stimulated frequent reply by multiple participants (Aviv, Erlich, Ravid, & Geva, 2003) and were strongly content- and task-oriented (Rovai, 2007). So, to help students more actively and productively engage in knowledge-constructing discussions, an instructor needs to detect students' posts that do not stimulate replies, identify content those posts introduce, and guide students to revise posts to encourage peers' responses. However, such monitoring would be very time- and energy-consuming, especially in large-enrolment courses (Hura, 2010). To set a stage for developing a classifier to automate these tasks, we proposed 10 rhetorical moves characteristic of the interactive mode of Chi and Wylie's ICAP framework (2014) and categorized fine-grained content in discussion posts using these moves. We then identified attributes of posts that triggered a greater number of responses. Rhetorical moves of “asking questions,” “requesting justification,” “building-on,” “giving a reason” and “making a claim” triggered more peer responses. Posts with moves of “disagreeing,” “comparing” and “making claims” predicted students' achievement on a test and an argumentative writing task. We propose analytics for learners and instructors about forming and revising posts to promote constructive discussions and subsequent achievements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The primary goal of this paper is to operationalize the connectivism approach into a new learning model with additions from problem-based and contextual learning that can be effectively implemented together, to improve socioeconomically diverse learners' educational outcomes (attitude and persistence) in STEM (Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics) areas. We model this approach through the development and demonstration of an innovative, evidence-based, and scalable how-to-learn program that leverages connectivism principles and technology. This paper uses the case of energy education to provide contextual relevancy and prepare learners for the high demand jobs of the future. The new model is developed within the context of Internet of Things (IoT), where students have a unique opportunity to participate in a real-world application of an IoT system for green energy governance. © 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

AB  - Social constructivism emphasises the role of meaningful interactions as a vehicle for learning. Meaningful interactions engage learners cognitively and socially with others to construct knowledge. Such interactions, however, require an environment specially designed to facilitate and guide learners’ cognitive and social processes towards the construction of knowledge. Forums in massive open online courses (MOOCs) could potentially provide such an environment. However, research on how MOOC forums are designed to facilitate and guide cognitive and social processes is scarce. This study adopts a qualitative lens to examine the specifications, pedagogical instructions, and guidance provided in the forums of 4 edX MOOCs to help learners engage in meaningful interactions. We sought to uncover how MOOC forums are designed to support the social construction of knowledge. We found that MOOC forums mainly seek to facilitate cognitive processes while giving scant support or guidance to social processes. Such a learning design might favour the individual over the social construction of knowledge. To a certain extent, our findings help explain the questionable effectiveness of MOOC forums as social learning environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Personalised learning (PL) is learning in which the stage of learning and the instructional approach are optimised for the needs of each learner. The concept of PL allows e-learning design to shift from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to an adaptive and student-centred approach. This paper aims to provide a literature review of PL based on: the PL components used to analyse learner diversity, the PL features offered, the methods used in developing the PL model, the resulting model, the learning theories applied and the impact of PL implementation. Thirty-nine out of 1654 articles published between 2017 and 2021 which were found by Kitchenham method were studied and analysed. The results are derived from synthesized through qualitative synthesis using thematic analysis. The results reveal that most of the articles used knowledge level and learner characteristics to analyse learner diversity. The teaching materials and learning path were the most widely offered PL features in PL model. There is a trend in determining PL features using the knowledge graph method and the use of machine learning classification algorithms to analyse learner diversity. The results also show that PL implementation improves learning outcomes and increases learner’s satisfaction, motivation, and engagement. Research analysing the impact of PL implementation on learning is limited. In addition, only a few studies explicitly referred to learning theory in relation to PL model development. Further research topics are suggested. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Which learning analytics (LA) approach might be the best choice for your teaching and learning context? Learning analytics as a field of research and application seeks to collect, analyze, report, and interpret educational data with the goal of improving teaching and learning. However, hasty adoption of learning analytics tools and methods that are simply convenient, promoted, or available risks allowing learning analytics to “drive the pedagogical bus.” In this paper, we propose that careful reflection on pedagogical design choices and the learning theory that underpins them can and should inform selection of relevant learning analytics tools and approaches. We broadly review established learning theories and the implications of each for pedagogical design; for each design approach, we offer examples of learning analytics most clearly aligned with the theoretical perspectives on learning and knowledge that have shaped it. Moreover, we argue that careful consideration of the learning theory underpinning the pragmatics of pedagogical design choices should guide LA implementation, and help educators and designers avoid the risk of gathering data on, and measuring outcomes for, activities that are not relevant to their pedagogical design or goals. © 2021, Canadian Network for Innovation in Education.

AB  - The use of established and discipline-specific theories within research and practice is an indication of the maturity of a discipline. With computing education research as a relatively young discipline, there has been recent interest in investigating theories that may prove foundational to work in this area, with discipline-specific theories and many theories from other disciplines emerging as relevant. A challenge for the researcher is to identify and select the theories that provide the best foundation for their work. Learning is a complex and multi-faceted process and, as such, a plethora of theories are potentially applicable to a research problem. Knowing the possible candidate theories and understanding their relationships and potential applicability, both individually or as a community of theories, is important to provide a comprehensive grounding for researchers and practitioners alike. In this work, we investigate the fundamental connections between learning theories foundational to research and practice in computing education. We build a comprehensive list of 84 learning theories and their source and influential papers, which are the papers that introduce or propagate specific theories within the research community. Using Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, we identify the papers that cite these learning theories. We subsequently consider all possible pairs of these theories and build the set of papers that cite each pair. On this weighted graph of learning theory connections, we perform a community analysis to identify groups of closely linked learning theories. We find that most of the computing education learning theories are closely linked with a number of broader learning theories, forming a separate cluster of 17 learning theories. We build a taxonomy of theory relationships to identify the depth of connections between learning theories. Of the 294 analysed links, we find deep connections in 32 links. This indicates that while the computing education research community is aware of a large number of learning theories, there is still a need to better understand how learning theories are connected and how they can be used together to benefit computing education research and practice. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020-2021 served as a wake-up call to educators across the globe that the issues of accessibility, diversity, and inclusion were not satisfied in the pre-pandemic online course environment. This chapter will offer the Quality Matters (QM) process as the gold standard in online course assessment, as it is grounded in four theoretical education frameworks and on the principles of Cognitive Load theory. In addition, QM is a premier assessment tool through its use of eight rubricbased standards modeled on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) concepts. The author will share her experience and lessons learned after participating in a QM audit for an online marketing course. Finally, the author strongly recommends adoption of the QM process as a viable solution to student demand for quality course design that fosters accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic to be confronted by humanity. As a result, social isolation has become the norm in most countries, with the consequent replacement of face-to-face classes by classes mediated by information and communication technology. Within this context, this work sets out to investigate the factors necessary for courses mediated by technology to attain their pedagogical objectives. Additionally, the study examines how subjects that develop hard and soft skills differ in a technology-mediated setting. The results show that the teacher’s digital competence on the technological platform and the metacog-nitive support available in the digital environment are significant factors for a course to attain its pedagogical objectives successfully. Lastly, the study revealed that hard skill disciplines, when they migrate to technology-mediated environments, are more likely to fail to achieve their educational goals than soft skill disciplines subject to the same migration. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Online learning has been adopted in distance education worldwide. The rise of the use of digital technology in teaching and learning has enabled distance education institutions to adopt online learning to reduce costs and improve student success. The purpose of this paper is to investigate appropriate teaching approaches that could be applied in an online learning model to achieve the desired success in student progress without reducing student autonomy. The results of this study indicate that cognitivism, social constructivism and connectivism form the basis of relevant teaching approaches in the 21st century with regard to curriculum and material design. The success of the students' learning is determined by the conducive environment created by the educators using technological means. Teaching approaches, such as community of practice, the integrative approach, apprentice and experiential learning, project- and problem-based approaches, as well as a competency-based approach, seem to dominate the Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) environment in the online teaching space. Students and their lecturers continue to engage after their formal interaction on an online platform. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The issue of migrant integration in host communities is of major importance, because its effectiveness can influence employment opportunities, social cohesion, and economic welfare, creating equal opportunities among citizens. One of the greatest challenges towards this goal is the limited knowledge of the language of the host community, which can create miscommunication and additional difficulties to migrants. Basic language training is important, but it is of little help when migrants are confronted with the language used in complex procedures that are required for their inclusion in the new country of residence. This paper, which is descriptive and explorative in nature, focuses on the targeted digital solutions offered by the EU-funded easyRights research project that can help migrants effectively communicate and receive guidance, in order to handle the demands of various inclusion-related procedures that may differ from one country to the other. One of the digital tools presented in the paper aims at facilitating familiarization with the required domain-specific vocabulary, while the second one intends to offer pronunciation training, including training for the domain-specific words, in order to equip migrants with the knowledge and skills they need to communicate effectively. The two digital tools, which could act synergistically, employ advanced technology and are part of a technological pathway, whose aim is to assist migrants exercise their rights in the process of their integration in a new country. Implications are also discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The concept of the massive, open, online course (MOOC) is not new, but high-profile initiatives have moved MOOCs into the forefront of higher education news over the past few years. Members of institutions of higher education have mixed feelings about MOOCs, ranging from those who want to offer college credit for the successful completion of MOOCs to those who fear MOOCs are the end of the university as we know it. We set forth to investigate the quality of MOOCs by using the Quality Matters quality control framework. In this article, we present the results of our inquiry, with a specific focus on the implications the results have on day-to-day practice of designing online courses. © Lowenthal and Hodges.

AB  - Serious gaming appears to be a promising research area with applications in education. In this article, trying to investigate new pathways in the evaluation of game design, a proposed framework variation is presented that is based on the frameworks proposed by Slimani et al., and Garris et al. Furthermore, specifically chosen cases of serious games are described in detail, to show how game-based learning and serious gaming can be combined efficiently in the educational context. The final part of this study contains an experiment on human motivation, with a sample of 50 student participants in the age group 18-25. The participants are questioned to three basic questions with basic objective to examine to what extent their three basic needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness are fulfilled. The findings show a positive attitude of students to the evaluated serious games and their utilization for educational purposes. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study explored the impact of using makerspaces in higher education. The paper sought to investigate the effects of constructionism approach on students learning outcomes in the setting of makerspaces which allows community members to design, prototype and manufacture items using tools that would otherwise be inaccessible or unaffordable such as 3-D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and CAD/CAM software. The case study involves students in the Design Program at Effat University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In such a makerspaces environment, results based on course learning outcomes in product design showed that students perform better learn creative ways to problem-solving, and engage effectively through creative experimentation. Further empirical research into the effectual relations between design and 3D constructions may further demonstrate the vital importance of makerspaces on students’ learning performance and mastery of skills in the context of higher learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - In this text Hasse presents a new, inclusive, posthuman learning theory, designed to keep up with the transformations of human learning resulting from new technological experiences, as well as considering the expanding role of cyborg devices and robots in learning. This ground-breaking book draws on research from across psychology, education, and anthropology to present a truly interdisciplinary examination of the relationship between technology, learning and humanity. Posthumanism questions the self-evident status of human beings by exploring how technology is changing what can be categorised as "human". In this book, the author applies a posthumanist lens to traditional learning theory, challenging conventional understanding of what a human learner is, and considering how technological advances are changing how we think about this question. Throughout the book Hasse uses vignettes of her own research and that of other prominent academics to exemplify what technology can tell us about how we learn and how this can be observed in real-life settings. Posthumanist Learning is essential reading for students and researchers of posthumanism and learning theory from a variety of backgrounds, including psychology, education, anthropology, robotics and philosophy. © 2020 Cathrine Hasse.

AB  - The research aims to develop science learning media using a valid, practical, and effective problem-based learning integrated Moodle web to improve the technological literacy of junior high school students. Learning media development using the stages of Lee and Owens (2004) includes assessment/analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. At the implementation stage, it used a quasi-experimental research design with the type of pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design. We conducted this research at Al Rifa'ie Gondanglegi Modern Junior High School, Indonesia. The implementation used two different classes: class VIII A as the experimental class (PBL with science learning media using PBL-based Moodle web) and VIII B as the control class using the PBL learning model. The validity test results of media, materials, and science education practitioners were 98.13%, 100%, and 99.37%, with the three categories being very valid. The results of individual, small group, field, and conduct pilot tests were 84.10%, 83.93%, 89.79%, and 86.32%, with very practical categories. The effectiveness test results using a single ANCOVA test with p < 0.05 showed that the science learning using the PBL-based Moodle web significantly affected technological literacy compared to students who were taught only with PBL. Science learning media using the Moodle web that has been developed can be used by science teachers. Furthermore, the PBL-based Moodle web can also be formed from other subjects to improve the technological literacy skills of junior high school students and various other 21st-century skills. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - The progress of ubiquitous information technologies has led to the arrival of entirely new environments where interaction amongst its users takes place. The means of communication, learning environments and methods of enhancing students' competence have changed in both academic and professional settings. The book aims to investigate if the implementation of a virtual learning environment into regular foreign language instruction, as an augmentation of the regular classroom practice, has an impact on adult learners' speaking (productive skills), listening (receptive skills) and grammatical competence. However, what was meant as a localised study became the new normal and a global reality as the coronavirus impacted all aspects of education. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

AB  - The rapid shift to online learning, accelerated by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought both convenience and unforeseen hurdles. Despite the appeal of flexible education, the attrition rates in online courses remain persistently higher than in traditional face-to-face counterparts. This escalating issue impacts individual students and threatens the stability of entire learning institutions. The imminent need for a comprehensive solution to address the root causes of high attrition rates has never been more critical. Behind the statistics lies a more profound concern - many online learners, representing diverse demographic, ethnic, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds, feel a disconnect. The sense of isolation and challenges rooted in economic and social factors have created an educational landscape where students are more likely to abandon courses. This jeopardizes individual learners' academic journey and undermines the sustainability of higher education institutions. In the face of these challenges, the book serves as a beacon, shedding light on the multifaceted issues contributing to attrition in online courses and offering actionable strategies for educators and administrators. Incorporating the Human Element in Online Teaching and Learning, meticulously crafted for college professors, researchers, graduate students, policymakers, instructional designers, and college administrators, provides a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating the attrition crisis in online education. The book equips educators with culturally responsive pedagogical practices by addressing the critical need for humanistic engagement in online courses, ensuring that online learning spaces become more inclusive and supportive. As a result, the strategies outlined in this book empower educators to create a sense of belonging for diverse student populations and offer a blueprint for colleges and universities to foster professional development opportunities. Ultimately, this transformative guide is a cornerstone in reshaping the online learning experience, ensuring that every student, regardless of background, can thrive in the digital classroom. © 2024 by IGI Global.

AB  - The proliferation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Education, Teaching, Training, Learning, and the operational application (Performing) of acquired knowledge, skills, and competencies in contemporary social environments has directly influenced the transformation of early Networked Learning (NL) concepts into a Global Learning Infrastructure. Creating cooperative/collaborative stakeholders networks composed of learning subjects, objects, and competencies consumers, exposes the significant potential for gaining overall social progress. The main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure. The mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular Education, Learning, Teaching, Training, and Performing (Research, Development, Production, and Service) endeavors. In this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students' portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. It is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperative/collaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The aim of the research is to identify the effect of a scenariobased learning in the mathematics achievement and the mental motivation for fifth – scientific grade students in high school. To achieve it, the researchers adopted the experimental research method with two groups (experimental and control) with a post-test. The research community was identified, which represents the fifth scientific grade students from the first Karkh Education Directorate. The sample (60) students were chosen intentionally, and was divided into two groups: an experimental group that studied according to the scenario-based learning model; and a control group studied according to the usual method. For the purpose of collecting data for the experiment, the achievement test was built, in its final form, consisting of (10) test items of the type of essay, and the mental motivation scale, in its final form, consisting of (60) items. Appropriate statistical analyzes were conducted, and the psychometric properties of the test and scale were confirmed. The results indicated that the students of the experimental group who studied according to the scenario-based learning model outperformed the students of the control group who studied according to the traditional method © 2023,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

AB  - This book chronicles a 10-year introduction of blended learning into the delivery at a leading technological university, with a longstanding tradition of technology-enabled teaching and learning, and state-of-the-art infrastructure. Hence, both teachers and students were familiar with the idea of online courses. Despite this, the longitudinal experiment did not proceed as expected. Though few technical problems, it required behavioural changes from teachers and learners, thus unearthing a host of socio-technical issues, challenges, and conundrums. With the undercurrent of design ideals such as “tech for good”, any industrial sector must examine whether digital platforms are credible substitutes or at best complementary. In this era of Industry 4.0, higher education, like any other industry, should not be about the creative destruction of what we value in universities, but their digital transformation. The book concludes with an agenda for large, repeatable Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) to validate digital platforms that could fulfil the aspirations of the key stakeholder groups – students, faculty, and regulators as well as delving into the role of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as surrogates for “fees-free” higher education and whether the design of such a HiEd 4.0 platform is even a credible proposition. Specifically, the book examines the data-driven evidence within a design-based research methodology to present outcomes of two alternative instructional designs evaluated – traditional lecturing and blended learning. Based on the research findings and statistical analysis, it concludes that the inexorable shift to online delivery of education must be guided by informed educational management and innovation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.

AB  - Based on the instructional interaction principles outlined by Chen and Wang (2016) in third-generation distance learning, this study employs a recursive logical perspective on the evolution of the theory of interaction in distance education. It constructs a structural equation model to measure the mediating utility path of the learner’s proactive personality and the interactive outcomes of online learning to test the hierarchical relationships in the instructional interaction concepts of third-generation distance learning. The study proposes a mechanism for cultivating and transforming proactive personality, aiming to explore the potential pathways for online differentiated instruction management based on learner personality traits. The research conclusions reevaluate the conceptual hierarchy under the third-generation distance learning interaction theory and confirm the positive and significant impact of proactive personality on learners’ online learning interaction. According to the data analysis, recommendations are made for the implementation of personalized teaching strategies based on the strength of the proactive personality: (1)Teaching strategies for individuals with strong proactive personalities should adhere to principles of open environments, challenging tasks, shaping central roles, and immediate high-frequency interactions; (2) Teaching strategies for individuals with weak proactive personalities should adhere to principles of creating an active atmosphere while downplaying identity, stimulating introspection and providing timely feedback, and offering simple and low-pressure tasks; (3) By mixing individuals with a wide range of proactive personality traits and implementing intra-group settings and teacher-driven approaches, the learning drive of individuals with strong proactive personalities can be leveraged to benefit those with weak proactive personalities. This study contribute to explain the explicit process of learners’ cognitive networks and presents the direction of knowledge transmission and its periodic forms, which enriches the theoretical basis for the evaluation of instructional interaction in online courses and provides practical references for personalized teaching interaction strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The predominance of western paradigms and a frequent failure to consider and theorize the non-neutrality of schools and technology leaves an ontological and epistemological gap in educational technology studies. Specifically, it leads to thin research on the role of power, the collective, and the intersections with technology that can alter our interaction with the world. The current narrow approach hobbles the imagination of the field, constraining the possibilities for technology and education. We propose three research frames that are relatively new to the field of educational technology. These frames acknowledge the interdisciplinary and socially embedded nature of technology and the systems of power that exist in both schools and technology: Collective Framing, Critical Race Theory (CRT) Framing, and Ecological Framing. We synthesize the possibilities of these approaches for educational technology research, identifying how they can push the field to consider different epistemological, ontological, and axiological approaches. We identify potential areas of research and consider implications for the field of educational technology. While each frame offers its particular theoretical contribution, taken together, all three frames suggest the sociocultural, epistemological, and political limitations of the field known as educational technology. Finally, we return to the initial wonderings of our paper, imagining the possibilities for ed tech research if the field confronted the hegemonic western paradigms embedded within itself. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - This article examines the impact of personality traits, learning styles, gender, and online course factors (course difficulty, group affiliation, provided materials, etc.) in the academic success of students taking online courses and their overall success rate through traditional classes. Students’ performance in the online learning environment is still a new perception, and a fair numbers of details are still unknown, in stark contrast to the details known in regard to traditional learning methods. Different types of learners respond differently to online and traditional courses. A case study was performed in which students were asked to attend two online courses, with different difficulty levels, during one semester. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine which factors are significant for the academic performance of students taking online courses, as well as for their overall academic success. Findings from the case study indicate that female students score slightly better, course difficulty has impact on test results, emotional students are more susceptible to online environments, and learning styles are more difficult to identify in online classes. © 2021.

AB  - The imparting of knowledge and skills in STEM education, especially under the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic, is increasingly taking place online and through digital formats. The partially asynchronous instruction eliminates, on the one hand, the social relation in the learning process and, on the other hand, the direct experience with physical objects. Here, the digital learning systems provide learning tools and controls to support the learning process on a general basis. Existing methods for simulating physical objects (digital twins) are also used to a minimal extent. The following approach presents a learning system framework that enables individualized learning, including all dimensions (social, physical). Implementing a concept that uses a personalized assistance system to orchestrate the individual learning steps enables efficient and effective learning. Applying the learning system framework exemplifies the STEM education at Reutlingen University in the logistics learning factory Werk150.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter considers the online discussion forum in music education. It begins with an overview of factors leading to faculty frustration with online discussions before considering how discussions fit within the context of several prominent learning theories, including Connectivism and Collaborativism, which specifically address the online platform. Particular challenges are explored and include post lengths, quality, language/style, group size, heated discussion, and faculty involvement in the ongoing conversation. The chapter concludes by offering a "toolbox" of best practice ideas in online discussion. Through use of examples, the section seeks to help faculty move beyond the tried and tired format of one post and two responses. Copyright © 2022, IGI Global.

AB  - Background: The act of virtual learning is defined through learning and practicing in an environment using digital/electronic content for self-paced through online teaching and mentoring. It explicitly deals with the interaction in an asynchronous mode of learning. The quality of teaching-learning depends on the utilization of digital technologies with the advancement in educational technology. There is a need and evaluation for the assessment and estimation of the impact of e-mental health interventions with the students learning through the virtual learning environment. Purpose/Hypothesis: This research evaluates the psychotherapeutic support for the students to overcome the psychological distress during this COVID-19 pandemic by using machine learning techniques. This mechanism evaluates the efficacy of the academic performance made by the students during the pandemic situation. This analysis involves a hybrid approach for the assessment in machine learning using a genetic algorithm with an artificial neural network upon statistical evaluation. The psychological factors are determined with a keen focus on behaviourism, cognitivism, and social constructivism. The metrics have been evaluated based on digital technologies (ICT) in remote access, individual learning process, flexible learning, cost-effectiveness, time complexity and scalability. Design/Method: The design process involves the 775 student responses with 27 attributes with differentiation of labels corresponding to behaviourism, cognitivism, and social constructivism. The preprocessed data is fed to genetic algorithm with processing parameters focusing crossover and mutation probability and then classified using artificial neural network. The estimation of academic performance is made using the techniques followed in virtual learning environment such as: 1. Online quiz (Quizizz platform) - Individual assessment 2. Flipped classroom activity - Individual assessment 3. MOOCs online courses - Individual assessment 4. Prototype design - Team activity 5. Research proposal - Team activity From the assessment process the each of the student performance is evaluated with regard to the course outcome of individual student in the learning environment. The variation has also been observed with the applicability of ALS and traditional practice methods. Results: The hybrid approach found to be good in the assessment and evaluation of academic performance and health interventions in terms of accuracy (88.18%), precision (94.69%), recall (92.24%), RMS error (0.202) and correlation (0.844) respectively. The statistical analysis and evaluation have been made using Fisher’s F-Statistical test, and the P-value is found significantly to be P<0.001. From the experiments, the factors that contribute towards web-based learning, blended learning, and online learning has been differentiated with the psychotherapeutic factors. A total of 775 samples have been used for analysis with the applicability of ICT tools and the pedagogical practices for the course. The factors contributing towards Behaviorism with a focus on interaction and response towards the learning environment plays a significant role in varying the academic performance of the student of about 20% in total learning rate varied significantly. Step-by-step analysis in virtual learning provides a good initiative for the student’s community to have a variation in the learning process. Virtual learning is one of the good practices if the ICT in education, process and its principles adhere more efficiently. © 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Since about 2010 e-learning has been embedded in educational practice and has become, surely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, increasingly important. Objectives: Although much has been written about e-learning, little is known about crucial didactic and pedagogical design principles for e-learning. This review tried to fill that gap. Methods: Based on a systematic literature review, 42 studies (out of 1857 unique hits) were included that address e-learning design in higher education. Open and axial coding was used for analysis. Results and conclusions: There were two continuums distinguished as important for e-learning: (1) the active learning continuum and (2) the authentic learning continuum. Those continuums appear to be useful to give a visual representation of included studies through an active and authentic learning continuum. This resulted in four clusters with (slightly) different properties. These properties vary from a relatively low to a high level of authenticity, and from teacher to student centred. Analysis also revealed four crucial aspects for e-learning design: (1) content scaffolding, (2) process scaffolding, (3) peer-to-peer learning, and (4) formative strategies. In general, most of the e-learning approaches demand an educational design that facilitates authentic learning and self-regulation. Takeaways: To help practitioners in realizing e-learning design, this paper will provide some concrete suggestions and tips for e-learning design. Furthermore, this research shows that more well-founded research is necessary to gain more insight in didactic and pedagogical design principles for e-learning. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Technology-enhanced learning (TEL), particularly in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM), revolutionizes educational approaches by fostering active, transformative learning and expediting the learning process. TEL employs various tools like online courses, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, virtual reality (VR), simulations, makerspaces, visual learning, and project-based learning, all contributing to accelerated learning in STEAM. A notable TEL innovation is the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI chatbots, exemplified by the release of GPT-3 in December 2022. These tools utilize extensive parameters to generate natural language and perform tasks such as classification and prediction, thereby offering personalized and collaborative learning experiences essential for STEAM education. The generative pre-training transformer (GPT), a leading model in natural language processing (NLP), excels in generating human-like text and handling complex tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. This chapter explores TEL environments that support transformative learning in STEAM, focusing on AI models. It reviews research on TEL's impact on STEAM education, discussing the constructionism theory and emphasizing TEL's role in creating engaging, student-centered learning experiences. However, challenges like technology access, instructor training, infrastructure, internet connectivity, and hardware resources are crucial. Additionally, the rise of AI brings ethical concerns regarding privacy, security, and potential biases in AI algorithms. Despite these hurdles, TEL's potential to enhance Transformative Leadership and Sustainable Innovation in Education: Interdisciplinary Perspectives STEAM learning experiences and accelerate the educational process is significant. By effectively implementing TEL strategies and leveraging LLMs and AI tools, educators can substantially improve learning outcomes in STEAM education. © 2024 by Tayeb Brahimi and Akila Sarirete.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted education institutions in over 150 nations, affecting billions of students. Many governments have forced a transition in higher education from in-person to remote learning. After this abrupt, worldwide transition away from the classroom, some question whether online education will continue to grow in acceptance in post-pandemic times. However, new technology, such as the brain-computer interface and eye-tracking, have the potential to improve the remote learning environment, which currently faces several obstacles and deficiencies. Cognitive brain computer interfaces can help us develop a better understanding of brain functions, allowing for the development of more effective learning methodologies and the enhancement of brain-based skills. We carried out a systematic literature review of research on the use of brain computer interfaces and eye-tracking to measure students’ cognitive skills during online learning. We found that, because many experimental tasks depend on recorded rather than real-time video, students don’t have direct and real-time interaction with their teacher. Further, we found no evidence in any of the reviewed papers for brain-to-brain synchronization during remote learning. This points to a potentially fruitful future application of brain computer interfaces in education, investigating whether the brains of student-teacher pairs who interact with the same course content have increasingly similar brain patterns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Teaching HCI in an undergraduate course for computer scientists is often a challenging experience, because the skills that characterize HCI are different from scientific and computational thinking that are the focus of most subjects of the curriculum. Often HCI teaching is organized as a set of lectures that are useful to learn concepts, but don’t increase the design skills of the students. This work reports the results of an educational experience where both learners and teachers were actively involved in a process of knowledge construction and design. This process usually happens in other domains, such as architecture or industrial design, but is not part of most computer science curricula. We chose as project a challenging theme: the design of eco-feedback interfaces that inform people about the consequences of their actions for the environment and help to take decisions for lowering energy consumption. Eco-feedback interfaces are also representative of the gap between the products available on the market and the results of scientific studies, evidenced also by a recent workshop about HCI education. The workshop evidenced a number of pitfalls in HCI education that in our educational experience we tried to overcome with appropriate methodologies. An additional challenging task was the attempt to organize all the design activities taking advantage of a platform for remote learning, stressing its limits. The paper will discuss all these issues, evidencing where the applied methodologies gave good results and where they need further improvements, with the final goal of giving useful advices for HCI educational experiences to come. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Learner motivation plays an essential role in overcoming barriers to achieve online learning success. Many health professions educators, however, are not familiar with evidence-based motivational principles and techniques that tap into learners’ inner resources to promote online learning success. The TEC-VARIETY (T-Tone; E-Encouragement; C-Curiosity; V-Variety; A-Autonomy; R-Relevance; I-Interactivity; E-Engagement; T-Tension; and Y-Yielding products) framework provides evidence-based principles and techniques that motivate and engage learners. Health professions educators can identify and assemble appropriate activities to motivate and engage online learners. Educators are encouraged to use Design-Based Research to guide their adoption of TEC-VARIETY and evaluation of outcomes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to define the problems and potential theoretical solutions to the problems in an automotive vocational teacher department. This study is part of a comprehensive study about the potential benefits of using the metacognition concept. Metacognition as the concept of learning-how-to-learn is needed for prospective automotive vocational teachers to conduct sustainable learning. This study is a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews (SSI) and a focus group discussion (FGD) to collect the data. Firstly, the SSIs were conducted twice, before and after the FGD. The first SSI explores the problems, while the second SSI was conducted after the FGD to gain a possible contextual solution to the problems based on the result of FGD. Secondly, an FGD was conducted to explore the theoretical solutions to the problems. The findings of the first SSI stated that teaching communication skills and sustainable learning are necessary to be equipped since the automotive technologies in industries have been being developed rapidly from time to time. Those skills were not facilitated well in the teaching and learning activities in the department. The integration into courses of teaching communication and habit of sustainable learning could be the possible solution. The FGD findings stated that the metacognition concept could be brought into teaching and learning to deal with those problems. The second SSI findings said that automotive fault diagnosis learning was chosen as the subject since this is a problem-solving and higher-order thinking subject. Also, the learning tool kit for this subject is still conventional, so it needs to be improved with the metacognition concept. © Communities in New Media.

AB  - Contemporary systems for supporting digital learning are capable of collecting a wide range of data on learner behaviours. The emerging science and technology of learning analytics seeks to use this information to improve learning outcomes and support institutional assessment. In this work we explore the potential for the spatial dimension in learning analytics, and we evaluate a prototype geovisualization system designed to support what we call spatial learning analytics. A user evaluation with geographers and educators was conducted to characterize the usability and utility of our prototype spatial learning analytics system. By helping us understand what our prototype system does and does not do well, we are able to suggest a variety of new ways in which future spatial learning analytics systems can be developed. © 2020 International Cartographic Association.

AB  - At the centre of the methodology used in this book is STEM learning variability space that includes STEM pedagogical variability, learners' social variability, technological variability, CS content variability and interaction variability. To design smart components, firstly, the STEM learning variability space is defined for each component separately, and then model-driven approaches are applied. The theoretical basis includes feature-based modelling and model transformations at the top specification level and heterogeneous meta-programming techniques at the implementation level. Practice includes multiple case studies oriented for solving the task prototypes, taken from the real world, by educational robots. These case studies illustrate the process of gaining interdisciplinary knowledge pieces identified as S-knowledge, T-knowledge, E-knowledge, M-knowledge or integrated STEM knowledge and evaluate smart components from the pedagogical and technological perspectives based on data gathered from one real teaching setting. Smart STEM-Driven Computer Science Education: Theory, Methodology and Robot-based Practices outlines the overall capabilities of the proposed approach and also points out the drawbacks from the viewpoint of different actors, i.e. researchers, designers, teachers and learners. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The article introduces new properties of prime numbers. An alternative method for finding prime numbers using linear algebra tools is discussed. The probabilistic approach is used to analyze the use of a new property as a means of finding prime numbers. Mathematical calculations of determinants composed of prime numbers were converted to sound according to a given pattern. To optimize the process of calculating and converting numbers to, a software implementation was performed. A MIDI format saved in a folder has been created. In the process of processing the received data, the program recorded a melody, which, when changing scales, gives a beautiful sound. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents three intersecting aspects of e-learning: theory, practice, and research. It begins with a review of the major theoretical frameworks to date - behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, digital media theory, and active learning theory - to demonstrate the ways in which e-learning is both similar and dissimilar to traditional modes of learning. The article then turns to a practical case study of e-learning, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the American Museum of Natural History and hosted on the Coursera platform. The case study demonstrates both how learning theory affords a template to guide MOOC creation, and how MOOC platforms can be a laboratory for e-learning instructional design. The article concludes with an example of e-learning research, demonstrating the importance of synergy among theory, practice, and research. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.

AB  - Learning in environments such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and its variations have become a turning point in the design and range of university courses offered, although there is some difficulty in transforming their pedagogical discourse. Additionally, flexible and skillful faculty are required to respond to the diversity and continuous social changes to ensure quality teaching. Understanding the transformations that emerge from the innovative experiences supported by these new learning environments requires an understanding of the faculty who perform them as well as their previous experiences, because it is they who interpret, filter and redefine the proposed changes. Using a pedagogical discourse-based approach, this paper analyzes the backgrounds of the faculty who participate in MOOCs, Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) or other projects, and interprets the factors that influence their understanding of the practices in these environments. We have found that despite the ignorance of the pedagogical issues of the MOOC phenomenon, faculty with traditional beliefs are compelled to transform their practices using this kind of course design. However, their interests are more focused on the social value of learning by promoting their research areas in an entertaining way, than on the pedagogical value of online education through innovating their practices. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - This chapter will explore the value and usefulness of lectures and seminars in delivering information to learners today and in the future. Teaching and lecturing are concerned with many facets. However, the two key aspects of the learning experience for any student are the content of the courses and how they are delivered. These two intertwined topics are the subject of this chapter. Most teachers are very comfortable delivering lectures and seminars with materials given to them by others, however often they need to adapt, modify, change or indeed construct their own courses too. Therefore, the course delivery and design are vital to the success and development of educators. Indeed, Jones talked about the "triadic" relationship of teaching being made up of three elements: the teacher, the learner and the material (Jones, 2005, p. 5). This chapter will look at delivery and design of the material, i.e., lecturing and course design, from the teachers' and learners' perspectives. What lectures are and how they are delivered will be examined with some relevant theories and examples will be given from the writer's professional experience. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - What makes some experiences more memorable than others? How can you better remember specific information later? Memories That Matter addresses these questions and more. The book is divided into three main parts, with each part focusing on a different aspect of memory. After the introductory first part, Part II discusses everyday uses of memory and why we remember, establishing a foundation for how memory is structured and stored in the brain. Part III dives into what makes us remember. Emotional and rewarding experiences are both more memorable than mundane experiences but are often studied using different approaches. Self-relevance and objects we can interact with are remembered better than less relevant information. The author explores these motivation-related influences on memory and considers whether a common mechanism underlies them all. Part IV changes the focus, discussing how we sometimes want to remember specific information that does not automatically capture our attention. The book considers evidence-based learning strategies and memory strategies, whilst also exploring real-world applications, with discussion of professions that accomplish amazing memory feats daily. The book concludes with a reflection on how the role of memory is changing as our world makes information increasingly accessible, particularly with the ever-expanding influence of the internet. Drawing from a variety of literatures and perspectives, this important book will be relevant for all students of memory from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and related health backgrounds. © 2023 Christopher R.

AB  - This article is devoted to improving the motivation of students to study and, in general, the quality of education in the context of global digitalization. Along with numerous existing methods, the internal component of thinking and perception as an integral part of it plays a significant role. Research has shown that the mathematical logic used in the creation of most algorithms is not identical to the logic of thinking. The combined fuzzy and genetic logic that guides the student only partially includes clear logical structures. Moreover, this inclusion is manifested in different students with different degrees of belonging. If the teacher understands and uses the degree of such inclusion, then students will be able to show results of education that seem to exceed their own capabilities. Examples of the implementation of matrix thinking with students of military accounting, technical and creative specialties, as one of the ways to digitalize knowledge, are given. An example of the implementation of digitalization of training with students of applied programmers is considered on the example of creating software based on the material passed in a related IT discipline. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A growing number of studies indicate that self-regulated learning plays a significant role in students’ academic achievement. However, research studies on design studio education in self-regulated learning are under-researched globally, including in Turkey. In this study, I developed a self-regulated learning intervention for industrial design studio education and examined its impact on students’ self-regulated learning strategies and design performance. Twenty six third-year industrial design students were tracked in a mixed-method research study conducted during a design studio course. Following the study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the students using self-report questionnaires and interviews. The jury grades of the students in the experimental group were compared with the grades of the students in the control group. Integrated data analysis indicated that activities for promoting self-regulated learning strategies such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, self-efficacy, and seeking help and information in design studios can assist design students to improve their strategy use and design performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The paper aims to present and discuss the results of a performance research related to the fusion between two advanced teaching methodologies and their latest evolutions: the practice enterprise (PE) and the massive open online courses (MOOC). Ongoing practices encourage the extension of experience to the synergy between PE and MOOC with particular attention to the preparation of different roles of the teaching staff represented by teachers, tutors and mentors. The hypothesis concerns how to evaluate PE and MOOC with the same methodology, distinguishing the real performances from the perceived ones. This result would pave the way for a common platform to use these advanced teachings together, perfecting their implementation. The document wants to argue that this fusion is not only possible but also necessary to implement the preparation of teachers for further diffusion of these innovative didactics in higher education programmes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Connectivism has been proposed as a theoretical framework to help ODE researchers and practitioners develop a better understanding of the dynamics and opportunities of the socio-technical context for networked learning. This chapter first reviews such long-standing learning theories as behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism and their limitations for understanding and developing recent networked ODE. It then introduces connectivism including its development, key concepts, strengths and weaknesses, and analyses recent studies and practices applying connectivism in networked learning contexts such as MOOCs. The chapter concludes with directions for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Recommender systems provide the ability to personalize and adapt environments for student learning. To customize learning experiences, applications of recommender systems research in education have resulted in evidence of various recommender system approaches such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based. This research focuses on those applications in higher education when given a non-MOOC classroom setting and examines the theoretical basis for the approaches. Learning and information systems theories are considered in this systematic review of the literature published from 2017 to early 2022. Findings indicate varying adaptive learning design recommender approaches and the potential to build the theoretical base of both learning and information systems theories. © 2023 Issues in Information Systems.

AB  - This chapter considers the onlie discussion forum in music education. It begins with an overview of factors leading to faculty frustration with online discussions before considering how discussions fit within the context of several prominent learning theories, including Connectivism and Collaborativism, which specifically address the online platform. Particular challenges are explored and include post lengths, quality, language/style, group size, heated discussion, and faculty involvement in the ongoing conversation. The chapter concludes by offering a " toolbox" of best practice ideas in online discussion. Through use of examples, the section seeks to help faculty move beyond the tried and tired format of one post and two responses. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - Learning theories lay at the core of every educational paradigm; especially applicable to MOOCs are the ones that originate in constructivism. Connectivism is a de facto learning theory that is framing the growing enthusiasm surrounding the design and the worldwide dissemination of MOOCs. This chapter shows how connectivism has become the digital age's natural successor to the stream of learning theories that preceded it, despite its questionable ability to fulfill the totality of pre-digital requirements drafted for learning theories. As a disruptive phenomenon, several obstacles to materializing the promise of inclusiveness and equality in access to learning that is signified by MOOCs remain, including learner autonomy, presence (cognitive, social and teacher's) and critical literacies, as well as recognition, validation and accreditation. Finally, fostering the widespread development of the set of educatorś skills essential to fully implement connectivism is needed in order to fully reap the potential benefits of MOOCs. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - This article is devoted to the geometric representation of sets. The paper presents an implementation that allows using operations on sets to build any images. For this algorithm, the equations of first-and second-order lines on the plane and first-and second-order surfaces in space are used. Restrictions are introduced by setting segments on the coordinate axes, indicating whether lines or surfaces belong to these segments. Inequalities are used to create the shaded area of the drawings. In the course of research on this topic, a software tool was developed that allows you to model drawings using the entered formulas, build images based on a set of operations on given sets of points, which allows you to have an analytical description of the drawings. This software tool can be used both in the educational process to test the correctness of the assimilation of the material, and to create flat geometric shapes and three-dimensional bodies for the purpose of engineering the optimal forms of structures and various parts. This application allows the user, performing operations with mathematical expressions and inequalities, to get a graphical display of the result with a mathematical description of any part of the figure. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - This article is devoted to increasing students ' motivation to learn by means of internal settings set by the teacher to himself, aimed at establishing a common frequency with students. Along with numerous existing methods, the internal energy of the teacher plays a significant role. Research has shown that in the absence of this source for the teacher, the role of other methods is sufficiently reduced. If the flow of energy from the teacher finds its common channel with the flow radiated by students, and it will be on the same frequency, then the phenomenon of resonance occurs, the effect of the lesson will increase at times. Students under these conditions show results that exceed their own capabilities. A statistical study of the hypothesis put forward about the influence of waves of a certain frequency coming from the teacher on the thinking and motivational processes in learning is carried out. The statistical distribution of the sample is given. Numerical characteristics are calculated: sample average and sample variance. The law of distribution of performance indicators according to the point-rating system is established. The article proposes a twelve-level system of cognition with a core in the innovation. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

AB  - Predictive analytics with Big Data in education will improve educational programs for students and fund-raising campaigns for donors (Siegel, 2013). Research in both educational data mining (EDM) and data analytics (LA) continues to increase (Siemens, 2013; Baker and Siemens, 2014). The key elements of recruitment, learning, and retention can be tracked and increased over time in both cases for administrators and donor development. A few early examples of Big Data programs in these key areas of formal education will be reviewed. The paradigms of educational psychology can inform the construction of systems that maximize “engagement.” Contemporary educational technology enables the personalization of education whether face to face or at a distance. More responsive evaluation systems will allow the school to demonstrate the effectiveness of its services. There is more opportunity for education as a sustainable enterprise with the implementation of Big Data, both locally and globally. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The problems of most Learning Management Systems (LMS) are first of all of a pedagogical nature and then of a technical one. Studying these problems, which are interrelated, provides a useful conceptual reference that enables us to design a new model for a more relevant solution. In this paper, a new conceptual model of an LMS is presented. The model is based on the hybridization between four learning theories, namely the traditional pedagogy, the behaviorism, the cognitivism, and the social constructivism. We will present at first each of these learning theories by discussing both their advantages and limits. Then, together the main principles of these learning theories and the technical functionalities of the proposed LMS that result from the hybridization of these principles are outlined. We finally discuss the implications of the new conceptual model for how to design and develop new LMS that fit the needs of their final users, in particular learners. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The main purpose of this research is to apply the 4PADAFE Methodology so that teachers can develop their digital skills. Educators have to develop 21st century digital skills to improve their didactic practice and innovate their classes in all kind of modalities of study. Educational institutions, faced with the new demands of the knowledge and information society, have to head towards the transformation of new teaching and learning models. The theoretical foundations of the methodology proposed are behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism as a transversal axis in a flipped classroom and student-based learning context. The importance of the methodology lies in the fact that, being a comprehensive methodology, it encompasses pedagogical, methodological and technological components as well as didactic strategies, focusing on developing digital skills. In order to reach the objectives established in this research project, surveys were applied on teachers from different educational institutions and, consequently, a quantitative analysis of the digital skills proposed by this methodology was carried out. As main findings, it is evident that the 4PADAFE Methodology contributed to developing digital skills in teachers through the accompaniment in the systematic process that guided the development and construction of a massive virtual classroom. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Learning technologies enable interventions in the learning process aiming to improve learning. Learning analytics provides such interventions based on analysis of learner data, which are believed to have beneficial effects on both learning and the learning environment. Literature reporting on the effects of learning analytics interventions on learning allows us to assess in what way learning analytics improves learning. No standard set of operational definitions for learning affected by learning analytics interventions is available. We performed a systematic literature review of 1932 search hits, which yielded 62 key studies. We analyzed how affected learning was operationalized in these key studies and classified operational definitions into three categories: 1) learning environment; 2) learning process; and 3) learning outcome. A deepening analysis yielded a refined classification scheme with 11 subcategories. Most of the analyzed studies relate to either learning outcome or learning process. Only nine of the key studies relate to more than one category. Given the complex nature of applying learning analytics interventions in practice, measuring the effects on a wider spectrum of aspects can give more insight into the workings of learning analytics interventions on the different actors, processes, and outcomes involved. Based on the results of our review, we recommend making deliberate decisions on the (multiple) aspects of learning one tries to improve by applying learning analytics. Our refined classification with examples of operational definitions may help both academics and practitioners doing so, as it allows for a more structured, grounded, and comparable positioning of learning analytics benefits. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Blended learning (BL), an innovative, technology-supported pedagogical approach, has been extensively adopted in schools and universities. The learning effectiveness of BL has been investigated in multiple domains of education, computer science, nursing, engineering, and psychology. To uncover the major trends of BL research, this study embarked on a bibliometric analysis of a total of 719 studies published in the recent 10 years (2013-2022) and indexed in the Web of Science core collection. Adopting a quantitative approach and the visual analytical tool of CiteSpace, the review study identified the development trends, the influential researchers and research institutions, and pivotal studies and topics of the field and informed its future progression. The findings revealed a growing trend in BL research in the past decade as reflected in the exponential growth in the number of publications and citations. Charles R. Graham, Chang Zhu, Robert A. Ellis, and Feifei Han were the most prolific, influential researchers in the field, and the Griffith University, the University of Hong Kong, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the Monash University, and the National Taiwan Normal University were the prominent research institutions, which engaged in frequent collaborations with others. The United States, China, and Australia were the top-3 contributors to BL research measured by the number of publications, and the studies conducted and reported by researchers in the USA, Turkey, Taiwan, and Spain were cited the most often. Document co-citation analysis unveiled the pivotal studies and topics of the research field, including blended course designs, institutional adoption, achievement, higher education, active BL, flipped classroom, and communication skills. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - Selecting the most appropriate components for a blended learning course is a multifaceted challenge influenced by various criteria. The impact of these influential criteria on the design process is not always obvious. The aim of this study is to assist academics in designing sustainable and engaging blended courses by investigating the impact of these criteria on the selection of blended learning components. By selecting the right mix of components, academics can foster a sustainable and meaningful involvement of students in their learning process over time, ensuring that students’ engagement is both enduring and beneficial in achieving academic success. A modified Delphi survey was utilized in this study, involving the participation of eighteen experts experienced in instructional design and online teaching. The analysis primarily relied on quantitative methods, utilizing the mean (to indicate central tendency) and standard deviation (to measure dispersion) for presenting the experts’ responses. Additionally, qualitative analysis of experts’ comments provided deeper insights into their quantitative ratings. Findings indicate that face-to-face collaborative activities should be the preferred method of delivery for academics aiming to enhance students’ engagement and foster their higher-order thinking skills, which students often find challenging. However, this approach is most effective when the group size is manageable. For larger student groups, online collaborative work can be a suitable alternative, provided there is ample online resource support. The results also indicate that online self-paced learning can be advantageous for lower-order thinking learning outcomes, particularly in situations where teaching staff is limited. © 2024 by the author.
